          Forecasting Rent Growth in America's Most Walkable Cities: A Time

        <p>
          A year ago, my partner and I relocated to a different neighborhood
          when our rent increased by over $300. This sudden increase came as a
          shock to us, as we had not experienced such a significant hike in the
          past six years. This made me curious about the situation in other
          cities across the country. Were they facing a similar trend? And if
          so, which cities were being hit the hardest? Furthermore, I wondered
          if there were any cities that were both urban and walkable while still
          maintaining reasonable rent prices.

              After clarifying the aim of my project, I began searching for
              relevant data sources. While I came across several well-known
              databases containing rental price information, I found one
              database particularly well-done for a project like this, allowing
              me to start using it immediately. It contained a comprehensive
              time series of the percentage growth of monthly rent prices in 130
              U.S. cities over the last five years. I found it on
              apartmentlist.com.<br /><br />I chose the ranking system by
              walkscore.com to identify the most walkable cities, which I then
              selected for this time series modeling project.

          As mentioned, I am currently working on this project and have begun
          applying the initial models to the data. The Jupyter notebook I am
          using is still in the first draft phase and is filled with
          experimental and testing code. If you are interested in learning more
          about the specifics of this project,
